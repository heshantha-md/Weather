<p>A big thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diepstephanie/">Stephanie Diep</a> for her helpful SwiftUI tutorial on YouTube. I've been applying what I learned and have made some tweaks to a project, specifically addressing a bunch of updates in the bottom sheet and smoothing out some laggy animations. Curious about the changes? Feel free to check out my code to see the difference. A massive kudos to Stephanie Diep and the <a href="https://designcode.io">DesignCode</a> team.</p>
<p>Happy coding! ðŸš€</p>
